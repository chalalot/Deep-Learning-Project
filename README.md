# üìÉ DOCUMENT RECOGNIZER üì∑

üåêIn today's digital age, the efficient processing and analysis of paper documents have become increasingly vital for various industries and organizations. However, the task of accurately recognizing and extracting information from paper documents, especially when they are placed on random or cluttered backgrounds, can be challenging. To address this challenge, we present a groundbreaking project that leverages the power of deep learning to develop a robust model capable of recognizing and classifying paper documents irrespective of the background they are placed on.
### A model that automatically recognize paper documents and transforming into a scanned version

## ‚ö° Project description:

### üéØ Our goal:
The goal of this project is to train a deep learning model that can effectively identify and categorize different types of paper documents, such as invoices, forms, receipts, and contracts, even when they are surrounded by complex or unpredictable backgrounds. By harnessing the capabilities of deep neural networks, we aim to overcome the limitations of traditional optical character recognition (OCR) systems that struggle to perform well in such scenarios.
### üíª How we do it:
To achieve this, we will employ state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), along with advanced image processing techniques. The model will be trained on a diverse dataset comprising paper documents placed on various backgrounds, including cluttered desks, textured surfaces, and even real-life scenes. The dataset will be carefully curated, ensuring a wide range of document types, backgrounds, orientations, and lighting conditions to promote generalization and robustness.
### üì• Dataset description
For the testing and training data, we downloaded directly from kaggle and other various sources <Link>
However, in order to make the most out of the data, we have to create synthetic data by ourselves base on the raw data. The process consists of numerous steps, which involve mask producing, warping documents and combining with pre-downloaded background.
### ‚ôªÔ∏è Process
During the training phase, the model will learn to automatically extract relevant features from the input images and effectively distinguish the document regions from the background noise. The model's architecture will be designed to capture both local and global features, enabling it to recognize the intricate details of paper documents, such as text, logos, signatures, and stamps, while ignoring irrelevant elements in the background.
### ‚úÖ Validation
To validate the performance of the developed model, extensive testing will be conducted on unseen datasets comprising diverse paper documents and backgrounds. The evaluation metrics will include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with a particular emphasis on achieving high recognition rates for documents on challenging backgrounds. Furthermore, the model will be optimized for real-time processing to ensure practical usability in various applications, such as document management systems, automated data extraction, and archival processes.
### ü§è Summary
In summary, this project aims to leverage the power of deep learning to create a highly accurate and robust model for paper document recognition on random backgrounds. By enabling automated document processing in challenging scenarios, this technology has the potential to revolutionize industries that heavily rely on document analysis, saving time, reducing errors, and unlocking new possibilities for efficient information extraction.
